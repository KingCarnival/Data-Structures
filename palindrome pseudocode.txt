Pseudocode Palindrome

Create list variable testWord for the word that is to be tested
Store the word by splitting the letters across the list
Create list variable reverseWord created by printing testWord list in a reverse order
Perform if-then test to compare if testWord and reverseWord are equal
  If true print "This is a palindrome"
  If false print "This is not a palindrome"
