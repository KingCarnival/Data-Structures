Pseudocode Palindrome

Create list variable testWord for the word that is to be tested
Print "Enter a word to see if it is a Palindrome: "
Store user input in testWord as a list, each letter of the user input is in its own index
Store user input in reverseWord as a list, each letter of the user input is in its own index
Reverse the order of index in reverseWord
Perform if-then test to compare if testWord and reverseWord indexes are equal
  If true print "This is a palindrome"
  If false print "This is not a palindrome"
