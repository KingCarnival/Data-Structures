1. Add a method has Edge() to Graph which takes two int arguments v and w and returns true if the graph has an edge v-w, false otherwise.  Assume use of adjacency list.

    1. Declare array of length N (N = number of vertices)
    2. store vertices = number of vertices, store edges = number of edges
    3. Edges are stored in order pair form in edgesPairs example: {(0,1),  (0,2)...}
    4. Create method Edge() which is discrebed as follows:
        5. Create nested for loops to search edgesPairs
            for(i=0, i<length(vertices),i++){
                for a = 0, a<=length(edges){
                    if edges[i] == vertices + edges
                        return True
                        break
                    Then
                        return False
            }
        }
